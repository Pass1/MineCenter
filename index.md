## Welcome to the MineCenter help page

MineCenter allows you to keep track of your mining rig via the ethermine interface. Once installed, you can add a widget to your home screen and at a glance you will be able to see what is going on.

### Setup

First lets configure the app for your miner

1. Launch the app
2. Paste in you miner
3. Save

Now let us add the widget to your home screen. Before we do that, we don't want to screw up you nicely layed out icons, so go to an app page wher you have a nice 2x2 space. Now let's add the widget:

1. Hold down on an empty part of the screen until the icons start wiggling
2. Tap the + icon in the top left to add a widget
3. Search for MineCenter
4. Go ahead and add the widget and place it to your liking
5. Click Done in top right

You are all set now!

### Known issues

The widget provide a "Last update" time. This is affected by 2 things:

1. The Ethermine pool updates the information at predefined intervals (just like when you check on the website the information is not live).
2. If you have the widget on a page that you rarely visit, iOS will save battery by reducing the update interval. If yuou would liket to force a refresh, you can open the app and hit Save. This invalidates the current information and causes a forced refresh. However, if there is no new data from Ethermine, the "Last update" time will not change, as it is displayed from the received data (i.e. not when the data was requested, but when the data was generted).
